$ node testrunner.js method hostname port path jsonFile numTests

method is GET or POST or PUT or DELETE based on what you want to call (See API for details)
hostname is the hostname or IP address that the server is running on
port is the port the server is running on
path is the URL pathname (/data or /metrics ).  IT DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY QUERY PARAMETERS.
jsonFile is the path to the JSON file containing the test case.

$ node testrunner.js POST localhost 8888 /data collect1.json 100
