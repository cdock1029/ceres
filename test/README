To run tests, use the testrunner.js script in the following manner:

$ node testrunner.js method hostname port path jsonFile

method is either GET or POST
hostname is the hostname or IP address that the server is running on
port is the port the server is running on
path is the URL pathname (e.g. /query or /modify, etc.).  IT DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY QUERY PARAMETERS.
jsonFile is the path to the JSON file containing the test case.  It is a real JSON file (no q= in front like before for GET requests).
